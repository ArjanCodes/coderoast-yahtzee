# coderoast-yahtzee

This repository contains both the original and adapted code for the Yahtzee Code Roast, a series where I refactor existing code projects with the aim to improve the design. You can also find the original code here: https://github.com/Endemoniada/yahtzee.

This is the link to the refactoring video on YouTube: https://youtu.be/l7E3y4te7sA
